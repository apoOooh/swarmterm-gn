- Add all seven Astera themes, bundled UI fonts and theme-specific density,

- Add native file clipboard import/export, internal drag-and-drop, progress,
  undo and bounded local deletion history with collision-safe restore.
- Add shared CodeMirror file tabs, language highlighting, find/replace, CRLF/BOM
  preservation, dirty-close guards and external-change conflict resolution.
- Add sanitized GFM Markdown previews, synchronized split scrolling, heading
  links and preview search, plus image/video previews with stable-change reload.
- Run supported files in a dedicated plain-shell pane, and open project paths
  printed in terminals in the integrated editor without respawning the PTY.
- Brand the fork as Swarmterm GN and disable upstream updater endpoints.
- Add headless integration coverage and Windows Rust CI checks.
- Add a tag-triggered Windows installer release workflow with version checks,
  release notes, SHA-256 checksums and publication after successful checks.
- Support Windows x64 in the GN fork; retain upstream platform code and history.
